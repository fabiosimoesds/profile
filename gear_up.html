    <h2>Main Features</h2>
    <p>Everything related to User and User Authentication is done with Devise.</p>
    <p>We use pundit to manage Authorization on Gear Up.</p>
    <p>The search mechanism is the main feature, we used the gem PG Search for that. You can look for gear in a time frame by location, sport or gear type. Or you can combine them to get the perfect selection </p>

    <h2>Challenges</h2>
    <p>It was the first work we have done in groups, so that was a lot to learn on how to manage the situation, which set up us to do Get Together later on.
      The DataStructure was a bit of a challange and suprised us a lot to know that a company like Airbnb only needs 3 tables to make their core business work.

  <div class="section">
    <h2>TO DOs</h2>
    <p>Frontend is something that we need to improve a lot still, but we have been learning a lot with our mistakes. Make the WebApp tottally responsive is the main go, and improve the User Experience too.</p>
    <p>We want to implement a chat room between Gear Owner and Gear Renter</p>
