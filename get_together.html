    <h2>Main Features</h2>
    <p>Everything related to User and User Authentication is done with Devise.</p>
    <p>We used Pundit to manage Authorization on Get Together.</p>

    <p>We used Noticed to create the notification and Stimulus to broadcast when You receive a notification.</p>
    <div class='images-div'><img class="app-img" src="images/gettogether_notification.PNG" alt=""></div>

    <p>Users can create a trip and Through that trip you can filter the buddies you can connect that will be in the same place, for the same sport at the same time.</p>
    <div class='images-div'><img class="app-img" src="images/trip_card_gettogether.PNG" alt=""></div>

    <p>Users can invite buddies to a chatroom so they can organize the details of the trip, the chatroom is live and handled with JavaScript</p>
    <div class='images-div'><img class="app-img" src="images/chat_gettogether.PNG" alt=""></div>

    <p>Users have a map with pins where you have been or where you are going next, done via MAPBOX API</p>
    <div class='images-div'><img class="app-img" src="images/my_profile_gettogether.PNG" alt=""></div>

    <p>Users see their own profile differently than they would see someone`s profile</p>
    <div class='images-div'><img class="app-img" src="images/other_profile_gettogether.PNG" alt=""></div>

    <p>Users can change their profile picture and banner</p>
    <p>Users can change add and remove photos to the albums</p>
    <p>Trip addresses are autocomplete, managed with the MAPBOX API again, we do that so we a certain we can get Longitute and Latitude from a certain address</p>
    <p>A album is created everytime you create a Trip</p>
    <p>The invitations are automatically created as soon as you create the chatroom, only the one who received or sent a invitation can join the Chatroom</p>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Data Base and Schema</h2>
    <p>The Data Base os managed with PostgreSQL, for photos we use Cloudinary. Below you can see the detailed Schema:</p>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Project Management and Design</h2>
    <p>We use Trello to Manage to project and the Design was made with Figma. For version management we used GIT and GITHUB</p>
    <p>Trello:</p>
    <div class='images-div'><img class="app-img" src="images/trello_gettogether.PNG" alt=""></div>

  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Challenges</h2>
    <p>The main challange was to think and structure the Data Base, tables and association between them. After that it was to chose the Features that we wanted to be implemented on the 2 weeks time scale. We have an endless list of features that we would like to have, but we had to chose the most essential ones.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>TO DOs</h2>
    <p>Frontend is something that we need to improve a lot still, but we have been learning a lot with our mistakes. Make the WebApp tottally responsive is the main go, and improve the User Experience too.</p>
    <p>We want to implement review on the Buddy trip</p>
    <p>We need to refactor the code</p>
